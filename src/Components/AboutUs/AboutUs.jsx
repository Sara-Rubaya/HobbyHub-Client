      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-8">ðŸ’¡ Why We Started</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        We noticed a gap between peopleâ€™s interests and real-life connection. So we built a platform that turns shared interests into real communities â€” where everyone feels welcome, inspired, and included.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">ðŸ‘¥ Join Us</h2>
